This UiPath automation workflow downloads the attachments from the Outlook mails saved on Local Drive.

Features:
1) The automation works for both the .eml and .msg file types
2) The bot iterates through the parent folders and it's subdirectories where the mail messages are stored and creates the same folder structure over in the Output folder.
